# Math Game - 2-Player Command Line Application


## Description

This is a 2-Player math game built with Ruby, designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Players will take turns answering simple math addition problems. Each turn, a new math question is generated by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is will be prompted with the question and must answer correctly to avoid losing a life.


## How to Play

1. Both players start with 3 lives.
2. The game will display a question for the current player to answer.
3. The player must input their answer through the command line.
4. If the player's answer is correct, they will keep their lives and move to the next turn.
5. If the player's answer is incorrect, they will lose a life.
6. At the end of each turn, the game will display the updated scores for both players.
7. The game continues until one of the players loses all their lives.
8. When one player loses all their lives, the game will announce the winner and the final score of the other player.
